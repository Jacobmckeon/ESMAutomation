Python
Install most recent version of python. You will need to pip install a few libraries. 
To do so type: pip install selenium
Modules needed: selenium, fpdf, pyinstaller.
Selenium and fpdf are used in the code whereas pyinstaller converts the 
python file to an executable.
To use pyinstaller run the command pyinstaller -F x.py 
Along with python the firefox gecko driver needs to be downloaded and stored in the same folder that the exe is stored

Codebase
All commands and methods are commented however any new methods that need to be added can be done so easily.
The main change in the codebase that will be required is the ip address, this can be seen at the end of the code, 
just replace with any new environment IP or any new passwords/usernames

Running The Code
The code once compiled into an exe can be run on any virtual machine or on local machine.
The Code produces screenshots, each labelled and organised into their own folder by Language. 
At the end of the automation a PDF is generated with the result of each test, the number of failed attempts and any error messages.
